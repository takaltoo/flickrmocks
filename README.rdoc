== Welcome to FlickrMocks

FlickrMocks makes it possible to Marshal responses generated from the FLickRaw
gem. This is useful for Mocking/Stubbing the Flickr interface for testing
purposes.

The FlickRaw::Response and FlickRaw::ResponseList objects can not be Marshaled
because they contain singleton's.

== Getting Started

1. Install flickrmocks:
       <tt>gem install flickrmocks</tt>

2. require 'flickrmocks'

3. You should be able to Marshal/Unmarshal FlickRaw::Response and FlickRaw::ResponseList
	classes. 

	FlickRaw.api_key = 'xxx your flickr api key goes here'
	a = flickr.photos.search :tags => 'dog'
	b = Marshal.dump(a)
	
	Marshal.load(b) 
		
== Rails Installation (Test::Unit)

Specify the gem dependency in your config/environment.rb file:

  Rails::Initializer.run do |config|
    config.gem "flickrmocks", :lib => "flickrmocks"
  end

Then:

  $ rake gems:install
  $ rake gems:unpack



== Note on Patches/Pull Requests

* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
